## Step 1: Read in the dataset `ages.csv`.

```{r}
# Code to read in the ages.csv data goes here! 
ages <- read_csv(here::here("Week2", "Preview", "Ages_Data", "ages.csv"))
```

## Step 2: Read in the dataset `ages_tab.txt`

```{r}
# Code to read in the ages_tab.txt data goes here! 
ages_tab <- read_tsv(here::here("Week2", "Preview", "Ages_Data", "ages_tab.txt"))
```

## Step 3: Read in the dataset `ages_mystery.txt`

```{r}
# Code to read in the ages_mystery.txt data goes here! 
ages_mystery <- read_delim(here::here("Week2", "Preview", "Ages_Data", 
                                      "ages_mystery.txt"), delim = "|")

```

## Step 4: Read in the dataset `ages.xlsx`

```{r}
# Code to read in the ages.xlsx data goes here! 
ages_xlsx = readxl::read_xlsx(here::here("Week2", "Preview", "Ages_Data", "ages.xlsx"))
```

## Step 5: Both `read.csv` and `read.table` have an optional argument called `stringsAsFactors`. Figure out what this does.
Enabling `stringsAsFactors` automatically converts strings to a factor

## Step 6: Find a way to use `read_csv()` to read `ages.csv` with the variable "Name" as a factor and "Age" as a character.

```{r}
# Code to read in the ages.csv with "Name" as a factor and "Age" as a character goes here! 

```
